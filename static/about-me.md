I’m Nikita Burmistrov, a next-generation software developer who mainly specializes in backend development with ASP.NET Core and SharePoint using C#. Also I have experience with JavaScript, Ruby, Python and PowerShell. I care about team processes. Along with DevOps I promote unit-testing, continuous delivery and quality control in the team.

You can find more details about my experience in [my resume](/static/files/resume.pdf).

I’m an aspiring tech writer and this blog is a manifestation of that. Here I share my personal experiences and write about topics that interest me. I may and will be wrong sometimes, our opinions may not coincide, feel free to write to me by [email](mailto:nikita@burmistrov.tech) or in the comments under the posts.

At the moment I live in Europe, in the Czech Republic. I love local culture and mentality. I speak English, Russian and limited Czech.

**Stand with Ukraine!**
